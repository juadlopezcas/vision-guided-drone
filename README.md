# Vision-Guided Drone Navigation System 

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous drone navigation system that uses computer vision to plan and execute safe flight paths. Three JHU high school interns, supervised by PhD students, collaborated to build a system comprising three main components: image detection, path planning, and drone control. The project emphasizes hands-on learning while creating a practical robotics application.
